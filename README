 Introduction
 ============

 The Wikipedia links (WikiLinks) data consists of web pages that
 satisfy the following two constraints:

   a. contain at least one hyperlink that points to Wikipedia, and
     b. the anchor text of that hyperlink closely matches the
	  title of the target Wikipedia page.

	  We treat each page on Wikipedia as representing an entity
	  (or concept or idea), and the anchor text as a mention of the
	  entity. The WikiLinks data set was obtained by iterating 
	  over Google's web index. 

	  Content
	  =======

	  This dataset is accompanied by the following tech report:

	  https://web.cs.umass.edu/publication/docs/2012/UM-CS-2012-015.pdf

	  Please cite the above report if you use this data.

	  The dataset is divided over 109 text files.

	  Each file is in the following format:

	  -------

	  URL\t<url>\n
	  MENTION\t<mention>\t<byte_offset>\t<target_url>\n
	  MENTION\t<mention>\t<byte_offset>\t<target_url>\n
	  MENTION\t<mention>\t<byte_offset>\t<target_url>\n
	  ...
	  TOKEN\t<token>\t<byte_offset>\n
	  TOKEN\t<token>\t<byte_offset>\n
	  TOKEN\t<token>\t<byte_offset>\n
	  ...
	  \n\n
	  URL\t<url>\n
	  ...

	  -------

	  where each web-page is identified by its url (annotated
	  by "URL"). For every mention (denoted by "MENTION"), we provide the
	  actual mention string, the byte offset of the mention from the start
	  of the page and the target url all separated by a tab. It is
	  possible (and in many cases very likely) that the contents of a
	  web-page may change over time. The dataset also contains information
	  about the top 10 least frequent tokens on that page at the time
	  it was crawled. These line started with a "TOKEN" and contain
	  the string of the token and the byte offset from the start of the page.
	  These token strings can be used as fingerprints
	  to verify if the page used to generate the data has changed. Finally,
	  pages are separated from each other by two blank lines.

	  Basic Statistics
	  ================

	  Number of Document: 11 million
	  Number of entities:  3 million
	  Number of mentions: 40 million


	  Finally please note that this dataset was created automatically
	  from the web and therefore contains some amount of noise.

	  Enjoy!
